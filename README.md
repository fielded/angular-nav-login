> Login components for NAV applications

## Installation

Install with `bower`:

```shell
bower install --save fielded/angular-nav-login
```

or `npm`:

```shell
npm install --save fielded/angular-nav-login
```

Depends on the following **runtime** services:

```
config
sessionService
toastService
mainService
```

Make sure your app registers them somewhere.

Then simply add `angularNavLogin` as a dependency somewhere in your project that makes sense and you're good to go.
